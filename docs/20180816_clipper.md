I recently started learning __Artificial Intelligence__ with python. Gradually I realized I've deeply dived into an ocean of very interesting and fun technologies. There are thousands of __open source__ projects posted on github.com and most of them are very straightforward.

Here is my experience of playing [clipper.ai](http://clipper.ai), which is *prediction serving system for machine learning*.

## Pre-requisite
- Python, of course. I use ```python3``` and have the following modules installed: ```numpy```, ```tensorflow```, ```tensorboard```, ```keras```, ```torch```, ```matplotlib```, etc. You can see your installed modules by running ```help('modules')``` in python shell.
- iPython shell (run ```sudo pip3 install ipython``` to install )
- Docker. I have ```Docker version 18.06.0-ce, build 0ffa825``` configured on my Debian Stretch machine

## Run

Simply follow the steps at [clipper.ai](http://clipper.ai) from its homepage to install the base and load Python modules. After that, you'd see that ```sum-model``` has been registered successfully and linked to application ```hello-world```.

At this moment, there are several containers running in Docker

I'll keep posting other tutorials about this and have fun in *prediction*.
